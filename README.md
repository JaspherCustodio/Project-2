# 📱 Responsive Screen Project

Welcome to the **Responsive Screen Project** — a simple web page that dynamically displays the screen size and adjusts responsively!

This project uses **HTML**, **SCSS** for styling (with media queries to practice responsive design), and **JavaScript** to detect and display the current screen size in real-time.
